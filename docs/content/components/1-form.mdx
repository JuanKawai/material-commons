## Description

DVKForm is a component that generates and manages a form based on a declarative collection of fields.

## Props

Available props for the DVKField Component.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| fields * | DVKField[] | | The array of fields to be generated. See below. | 
| defaultValue | DVKObject | {} | The object from which to initially populate the form. Changing this object later on, will not update the form. Please use the `key` prop to signal a form reset. | 
| onSubmit | (obj: DVKObject) => void | () => null | Called on form submit. This can be triggered by `Return` key or a `<button type="submit"/>` provided by `renderActions`.  |
| onChange | (obj: DVKObject) => void | () => null | Called when a change occurs on any field. |
| invalidFields | DVKInvalidFields &#124; null | null | The object used to display errors on the form fields. See [Validation](/validation) for more details. |
| ContentWrapper | ComponentType | React.Fragment | The component type with which the form content will be wrapped. Useful when integrating the DVKForm in cards or modals. |
| ActionsWrapper | ComponentType | React.Fragment | The component type with which the form actions will be wrapped. Useful when integrating the DVKForm in cards or modals. This effect can also be achieved using just `renderActions`. |
| renderActions | (formId: string) => ReactElement &#124; null | null | The render function returning the form actions. A form id is provided as a param to identify forms in nested scenarios. |
| bottomContent | node |  | The content inserted inside the form, **after** the fields. |
| children | node | | The content inserted inside the form, **before** the fields. | 
| className | string | | The css class prop passed to the `form` node. | 
| InputModal | ComponentType | React.Fragment | ðŸ”¨ Used to avoid circular dependencies. Planned for refactoring. | 

## DVKField

DVKField is the field object from which DVKForm builds each form field. 

## DVKDateTimeField

This field type is used for `date`, `time` and `datetime` inputs. 
It uses the pickers from [`@material-ui/pickers`](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/) (this is listed as a peerDependency), more explicitly 
[`DatePicker`](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/api/DatePicker) for date,
[`TimePicker`](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/api/TimePicker) for time,
[`DatePicker`](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/api/DateTimePicker) for datetime,

#### Example

```javascript
<DVKForm
  fields={ [
    { name: 'birthday', label: 'Birthday', type: 'date' },
    { name: 'validUntil', label: 'Valid until', type: 'date-time' },
    { name: 'lunchTime', label: 'We\'ll have lunch at', type: 'time' },
  ] }
  onSubmit={ handleLogin }
/>
```

#### Props

Available props for the DVKDateTimeField object.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| type * | 'date' <br />&#124; 'time' <br />&#124; 'date-time' | | The type of field to render. See above. |
| name * | string | | The unique field key. This is used as a `key` in the field list and as the name of the property on the resulted object. Must be unique. Can be nested (`person.birthday`). |
| label * | string | | The label rendered on the input. |
| required | boolean | false | If true, the field is marked as required and the form cannot be submitted without a values for this field. `onChange` does not take this into account. |
| disabled | boolean | false | If true, the field is marked as disabled as is readonly. It's value (if provided via `defaultValue`) is sent on both `onChange` and `onSubmit`. |
| errorMessage | string <br />&#124; DVKErrorMessages | null | The error text to be displayed (if string), or a map of error codes (from `invalidFields`) to the error text (if DVKErrorMessages). |

## DVKListField

This field is useful for rendering lists of sub-objects. Let's call the sub-objects **items** from now on.
A `DVKTable` (with edit and delete functionality) will be generated to display the items alongside an add button.
An `InputModal` is intended to be used to add items to that list.
The final result will be a property in the created DVKObject that contains a list of said items.

**IMPORTANT:** when using this field, make sure to pass the `InputModal` as a prop to the form.
This is used to avoid circular dependency and is planned for refactoring.


#### Example

```javascript
import { DVKForm, InputModal } from '@dvkiin/material-commons';

<DVKForm
  fields={ [
    {
      name: 'roles', label: 'Roles', type: 'list',
      fields: [
        { name: 'name', label: 'Name', type: 'text' },
        { name: 'isDisabled', label: 'Disabled', type: 'checkbox' },
      ],
    },
  ] }
  onSubmit={ handleLogin }
  InputModal={ InputModal } // !! this is very important
/>
```

#### Props

Available props for the DVKListField object.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| type * | 'list' | | Used to distinguish from other fields. |
| name * | string | | The unique field key. This is used as a `key` in the field list and as the name of the property on the resulted object. Must be unique. Can be nested (`type.attributes`). |
| label * | string | | The label rendered on the input. |
| fields * | DVKField[] | | The fields for each of the items. See above. |
| editLabel | (value: DVKListItem) => string | ({ id }) => `Edit '${ id }'` | Used to set the edit label in the table actions. |
| deleteLabel | (value: DVKListItem) => string | ({ id }) => `Delete '${ id }'` | Used to set the delete label in the table actions. |
| deleteMessage | (value: DVKListItem) => string | () => ' ' | The delete confirmation message. |
